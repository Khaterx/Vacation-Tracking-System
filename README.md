### üìÉ Pseudocode
```pseudocode
START

// Step 1: Employee logs into portal
IF employee IS authenticated THEN
    SHOW VTS homepage
    FETCH vacation requests history (last 6 months to next 18 months)
    SHOW vacation balance
ELSE
    DISPLAY "Access Denied"
    END

// Step 2: Employee creates a new request
PROMPT employee TO select vacation category WITH positive balance

IF category IS valid THEN
    PROMPT employee TO select start and end dates, hours per day
    PROMPT employee TO enter title and description

    // Step 3: Validate data
    IF input IS valid THEN
        CREATE new VacationRequest WITH status = "Pending"

        // Step 4: Check if manager approval is required
        IF manager_approval_required THEN
            SEND email TO manager WITH approval link
        ELSE
            SET VacationRequest.status = "Approved"
        ENDIF

        SAVE VacationRequest TO database
        DISPLAY "Request submitted successfully"
    ELSE
        DISPLAY validation errors
        ALLOW employee TO edit or cancel
    ENDIF
ELSE
    DISPLAY "Invalid category or no balance"
ENDIF

END
